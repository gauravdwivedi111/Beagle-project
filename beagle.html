    <h1>Beagle</h1>
    <p>
      The Beagle is a small to medium-sized hound known for its exceptional sense of smell and friendly temperament. Originally bred for hunting rabbits and other small game, Beagles are intelligent, curious, and energetic dogs. They have a strong tracking instinct, which makes them excellent scent hounds, but also means they can be easily distracted by interesting smells. Beagles are highly social animals and get along well with children, other dogs, and even strangers, making them great family pets. Their expressive eyes, floppy ears, and cheerful personality have made them one of the most popular dog breeds worldwide.
